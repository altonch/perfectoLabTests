# perfectoLabTests
These are Known-Good tests I used for the Perfecto Lab.

These tests are provided as-is. These are not an official offering from Perfecto or Perforce.

These tests are configured to use official JAVA JDK release 19. You can edit this value in the pom file in case you are using a lower version of JAVA.
I highly recommend to use JDK 17 as the lowest version. These tests may work with JDK 12, however this is untested.

These tests incorporate Perfecto's reporting SDK. The SDK should import when the tests are run.

I will not provide support for these tests. These are samples to show how you can use the lab with my known-good working test code.

Please do not submit support cases for assistance.
